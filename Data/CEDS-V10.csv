Economic Research Service Rural-Urban Continuum Code,"Rural-Urban Continuum Codes form a classification scheme that distinguishes metropolitan (metro) counties by the population size of their metro area, and nonmetropolitan (nonmetro) counties by degree of urbanization and adjacency to a metro area or areas. The metro and nonmetro categories have been subdivided into three metro and six nonmetro groupings, resulting in a nine-part county codification. The codes allow researchers working with county data to break such data into finer residential groups beyond a simple metro-nonmetro dichotomy, particularly for the analysis of trends in nonmetro areas that may be related to degree of rurality and metro proximity.","1 - Counties in metro areas of 1 million population or more
2 - Counties in metro areas of 250,000 to 1 million population
3 - Counties in metro areas of fewer than 250,000 population
4 - Urban population of 20,000 or more, adjacent to a metro area
5 - Urban population of 20,000 or more, not adjacent to a metro area

",Workforce -> Quarterly Employment Record,,,,"Workforce Notes: The most commonly available indication of where employment is located is at the state level. While federal data resources provide indicators outside of the United States, these resources will not represent the majority of the students found employed, which will be based on state UI Wage Data. There may, in some instances, be multiple states where employment is found. Note that it may be desirable to collect these data over time, in a longitudinal sense, to measure things related to persistence, change, and growth in employment.",000990,,EmploymentLocation,,https://ceds.ed.gov/cedselementdetails.aspx?termid=19992,Click here to submit comment

The sources listed are complementary, rather than alternatives. That is, State UI records only include information for employees within a state's boundaries. The WRIS II system can provide employment data for other states (from their UI wage record systems). State UI records do not include information about federal or postal service employment, nor do they contain information about military enlistments. FEDES provides access to that information.
